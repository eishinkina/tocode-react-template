## Used libraries
- [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) `npm install node-sass`

While installing node-sass, I encountered the following error - gyp ERR. This error happens to Windows users. The following worked for me to solve this problem:

Delete node-modules folder
`npm install node-sass@8.0.0 --save-dev.` 
The version was specified according to the node version  [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

`npm install`
